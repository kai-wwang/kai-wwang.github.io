Or, at least, they usually should. The reality is that if we can't refine the product into something that customers absolutely love, then yes, we're absolutely building the wrong product.</p>\n<p>And it happens. There is no lack of startup tombstones whose epitaphs are emblazoned with a once-great product idea that no one wanted (see Google Glass, New Coke, Segway, Betamax, Juicero...) Even the best companies with the most expansive budgets get it wrong.</p>\n<p>But we get it right when we let our customers shape the product by constantly obsessing over their feedback and asking, \"Yeah, but what if we could do this?\" over and over and over. All of those details, all of those questions, help shape what the product should absolutely be.</p>\n<h1>Start with Raw Clay</h1>\n<p>It's best to think of our initial product as just raw clay ready to be molded. When we frame the product in that manner, it helps us get away from the notion that we should have a final product out of the gates. Yes, it's frustrating — who wouldn't want to have the perfect product from the start?</p>\n<p>In order to get the feedback we need to refine the product, we have to get something out there for people to see. It won't be perfect — the initial products never are. Remember, we're using Google Search version 1,000 from what it was 25 years ago.</p>\n<p>Our initial \"raw clay\" is just the most basic concept of our product (in the startup world, it is called the \"Minimum Viable Product\" or MVP). We should launch our MVP early as a mechanism to find out what the product should be with user feedback and testing. The more we try to guess ahead of time, the more likely we will be spending valuable time and money running down the wrong path.</p>\n<h1>\"Yeah, but What if it Still Sucks?\"</h1>\n<p>There's a big chance that even after all of that effort, we still wind up a product that no one wants. Just because an idea is new or novel doesn't mean anyone wants it. Yet we also need to consider the fact that sometimes good products have bad launches.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we can't attract the audience we need to or have enough resources to build the product properly, or in some cases, we might have the right product at the wrong time. What matters is our ability to navigate from that point.</p>\n<p>We've been living this philosophy ourselves at Startups.com for over a decade. All of our products get morphed over time into what we think they should be based on what our users (you!) tell us. We don't even pretend to have the answers anymore; we've just slowly gotten better at asking the right questions! It's all we can count on.</p>\n<h1>In Case You Missed It</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.startups.com/community/startup-therapy/episode/121\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Forget \"Big Ideas\" — Start With Your North Star</strong></a> (podcast) We need to focus on what we are trying to achieve before taking action on any big ideas because some of these ideas don't necessarily lead to where we want to go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.startups.com/library/expert-advice/everyone-says-my-idea-is-dumb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Everyone Says My Idea is Dumb.

Time slipped right through my fingers. Next week, things will calm down.</em></p>\n<p>Every single one of us has had those exact thoughts about our workdays. But here’s the harsh truth: You won’t magically find or manufacture more time. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not when that big project is wrapped up. So, according to the laws of physics, you need to make the most of the time you already have.</p>\n<p>That’s where time management strategies come into play. These models go beyond the daily war with your to-do list, helping you execute meaningful work in an efficient and fulfilling way.</p>\n<h1>How do time management strategies help?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Time management strategies are specific frameworks or systems to maximize your time and energy. Put another way, they help you overcome several common time management roadblocks.</li>\n<li>Multitasking: Research shows that the human brain is incapable of doing more than one thing at once (unless you count autonomous tasks like breathing). When you think you’re multitasking, you’re actually context switching – rapidly jumping between various tasks. While it might make you feel like you’re dominating your to-do list, this constant switching of gears is a drag on your productivity. Time management strategies help you stop juggling and start focusing.</li>\n<li>Fires and emergencies: You know the feeling. Your intentions for your workday are quickly sidetracked by the latest three-alarm emergency that lands in your inbox. While time management strategies won’t keep these red alerts off your desk entirely, they will help you better discern what actually deserves your immediate attention, rather than continuing to play inbox whack-a-mole.</li>\n<li>Information overload: Meetings. Emails. Notifications. Calls. Documents. Requests. Day in and day out, you’re inundated with information. That cognitive overload (which is what happens when the volume or complexity of incoming information exceeds your ability to absorb it) causes us to be less effective by seeking out low-value tasks, overlooking important details, and overall just feeling stuck. The right time management strategy can help you filter through the relentless noise to find your starting point.</li>\n<li>Energy depletion: Everything we’ve already mentioned – from the last-minute requests to an information avalanche – quickly drains your tank. Time management strategies allow you to be more mindful of not only your time but also your energy levels. With the right approach in your toolbox, you’ll be better equipped to schedule work more strategically and avoid running yourself ragged.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>There are plenty of hurdles that time management strategies will get you over, but they’re not a fix-all. If you’re struggling with an unmanageable workload, bona fide burnout, or other mental health challenges, the right time management hack probably isn’t your answer. Those more complex issues require conversations with your company leadership and/or a trusted mental health professional.</strong></em></p>\n<h1>The fundamentals: 13 time management best practices that always hold water</h1>\n<p>There are several specific time management strategies you can use to make better use of your work hours. We’ll get to those frameworks in a minute. But, regardless of which of those you try, there are a few general time management best practices that are always a good idea – and a good place to start.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Audit your time:</strong> Want to make better use of your time? You need to know where you’re starting. Whether you use an automated time tracker or a simple notepad, keep track of your work hours and what you get done. Do this for at least a couple of weeks so you can spot trends and identify improvement areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Set goals:</strong> Your ultimate objective is to manage your time better, but that can feel broad and intangible. Instead, set time management-related SMART goals to encourage and monitor your progress, such as signing off every weekday by 5PM, or spending the first 15 minutes of every morning making a to-do list.</li>\n<li><strong>Stop procrastinating:</strong> Procrastination is one of the biggest culprits eating away at your precious work hours, but it can be tough to overcome. Set a timer, enlist an accountability buddy, or find another hack that nudges you to just get started.</li>\n<li><strong>Break down big tasks:</strong> Intimidation could be behind your persistent procrastination. So, break that big undertaking down into more manageable tasks and milestones. It’ll feel less daunting and also give you regular intervals to recognize and celebrate your progress.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentivize yourself:</strong> When you reach a milestone or cross off another task, treat yourself. Whether you go for a quick walk or grab your favorite snack, even small, seemingly insignificant rewards can encourage you to keep moving forward.</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> Time management is about focusing on your most important work. To do so, you need to parse out the meaningful from the mundane. Strategically ordering your work based on criteria like impact, deadlines, and effort required serves as a good foundation for any time management strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Schedule breaks:</strong> Even the most productive people need adequate time to rest and recharge. No time management system should be synonymous with constant, dogged work. Your brain quite literally needs breaks – brain activity research says so.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit distractions:</strong> Even the best time management strategy will suffer if you’re consistently waylaid by pings, pushes, and drop-bys. Try your best to minimize distractions, especially during times when you’re doing deep work.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your environment:</strong> Your work environment has a direct impact on your productivity. Sitting on your couch in the dark while hunched over your laptop isn’t conducive to peak focus. Find or create a quiet space with some natural light and at least a somewhat ergonomic setup to support your best work (and, you know, your back).</li>\n<li><strong>Get organized:</strong> Searching for what you need isn’t the most efficient use of your time. Get a decent organization system in place so that, when you’re ready to work, you can jump right in.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid multitasking:</strong> Even if you think you’re a whiz at doing several things at once, you’re doing your brain a disservice by trying to multitask. Instead, pick one task to focus on at a time. You’ll get it done better – and faster – than if you had simultaneously juggled it with two other to-do’s.</li>\n<li><strong>Understand your peaks and valleys:</strong> You know you best, so think about how your energy tends to ebb and flow throughout the workday. Paying attention to when you’re most focused and energized will help you make the most of those energetic hours, like saving your morning for deep work and cleaning out your inbox after lunch.</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate:</strong> You can only do so much with the hours you have. But there’s good news: You don’t have to do it all alone. Knowing what you can delegate (whether you hand tasks off to technology or another person) is one of the best ways to buy yourself more time and reserve your focus for your most meaningful and impactful work.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>5 time management strategies to maximize your time and energy</h1>\n<p>Now that you’re schooled on the basics, let’s take a look at four widely used time management frameworks.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Eisenhower Matrix</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A four-quadrant chart that helps you categorize all your tasks based on their urgency and their importance or impact</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Draw a square and separate it into four even quadrants. Along the y-axis, label those boxes with “important” and “not important.” On the top x-axis, label those boxes with “urgent” and “not urgent.”</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 700px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e460f003efb2745f85494891fe6895a8/2d1ba/unnamed-3-768x487.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 63.42857142857142%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"unnamed 3 768x487\"\n        title=\"unnamed 3 768x487\"\n        src=\"/static/e460f003efb2745f85494891fe6895a8/39600/unnamed-3-768x487.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e460f003efb2745f85494891fe6895a8/1aaec/unnamed-3-768x487.png 175w,\n/static/e460f003efb2745f85494891fe6895a8/98287/unnamed-3-768x487.png 350w,\n/static/e460f003efb2745f85494891fe6895a8/39600/unnamed-3-768x487.png 700w,\n/static/e460f003efb2745f85494891fe6895a8/2d1ba/unnamed-3-768x487.png 768w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\r\nNext, categorize each task on your to-do list. Is that slide deck important and urgent? It goes in the top left box. Is your expense report not important but urgent? It goes in the bottom left box. Once everything is sorted, you can approach each category like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Urgent and important:</strong> Do these first!</li>\n<li><strong>Urgent and not important:</strong> Delegate these if you can. Otherwise, tackle them next.</li>\n<li><strong>Not urgent and important:</strong> Schedule time for these in the coming weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Not urgent and not important:</strong> These can fall off your to-do list entirely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also called a “<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/prioritization-matrix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">prioritization matrix</a>,” this handy tool helps you filter through a lengthy task list and pull out the items that require your immediate attention.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>80/20 Rule</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A principle positing that 80% of your results come from only 20% of your efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Since time management is about getting the most meaningful work done, this strategy (also called the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Pareto Principle</a>) focuses on finding the highest-impact tasks on your list – with the idea that those will generate the biggest outcomes for your workday.</p>\n<p>You’ll likely be drawn to the low-hanging fruit and quick wins on your to-do list, but this guiding principle forces you to look at your tasks through a new lens: Which ones will have the biggest impact?</p>\n<p>Cleaning up your inbox probably won’t lead to a substantial result. However, compiling all the data that another team has been waiting on for days will.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Time blocking</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A method that involves splitting your day into segments of time and dedicating each one to a specific task.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Remember when you were in school and you knew what to expect during every moment of your day? At 11am you’re in chemistry class, at noon you have lunch, and so on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/blog/time-blocking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Time blocking</a> is a lot like that. You’ll create blocks of time on your calendar and assign certain tasks or groups of tasks to that specific spot on your schedule.</p>\n<p>For example, maybe you’ll address your emails from 8am to 9am, meet with the design team from 9am to 9:30am, and draft copy for a project from 9:30am to 11:30am.</p>\n<p>It might feel overly prescriptive or rigid. But this level of detail helps you take a more proactive approach to your workday, rather than letting emails, requests, and other people control your entire schedule.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Pomodoro Technique</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A strategy that breaks your workday into smaller chunks of time (usually 25 minutes) separated by five-minute breaks.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Your workday might feel daunting, but you could likely do pretty much anything if you knew it’d only take 25 minutes, right?</p>\n<p>That’s the concept behind the <a href=\"https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Pomodoro Technique</a>. The gist is that you’ll set a timer and work for a period of 25 minutes. When the timer goes off, you take a five-minute break. After doing that cycle (called a “pomodoro”) four times, you take a longer break of about 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>It’s helpful for a few reasons. For starters, it can amp up your focus by instilling a greater sense of urgency. Most of us are naturally competitive, so you’ll likely challenge yourself to get as much done as you can in that 25-minute chunk before your timer goes off.</p>\n<p>Plus, the Pomodoro Technique has built-in breaks. As counterintuitive as it seems, those regular opportunities to step away can give a major boost to your energy and productivity.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Not-to-do list</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A documented list of time-wasting tasks and negative behaviors you’ll consistently and reliably avoid</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> You’re familiar with a to-do list, but this is the exact opposite. Rather than making a list of all of the things you want to get done, you’ll write a list of the things you won’t do.</p>\n<p>What are the vices or bad habits that consistently distract you from your work? Or the tasks that you’ve supposedly delegated but still manage to find you anyway? Or the things you know you should say “no” to but have a hard time resisting?</p>\n<p>Those are the types of things that go on your not-to-do list. While it might sound like a silly exercise, writing things down is powerful. This simple activity can help you gain clarity about the areas where you need to be careful and resist falling into old, unproductive patterns and routines.</p>\n<h1>Which time management strategy should you try?</h1>\n<p>These five time management strategies put you in the driver’s seat of your tasks, schedule, time, and energy, each in a different way. But that doesn’t mean you should roll out all of them at once.</p>\n<p>You’ll see better results if you pick one. Not sure how to figure out which one will be the biggest difference-maker for you? This one-minute quiz will point you in the right direction.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Accessible Clickable Cards","description":"Clickable cards with multiple child links","slug":"/blog/clickable-cards","date":"2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Accessibility","CSS"],"draft":false},"html":"<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/code-n-cool/pen/xxRBvgd?editors=1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Codepen Demo</a></p>\n<p>Card layout where the card itself isn't an anchor link, but the whole card is clickable (with a <code class=\"language-text\">:before</code> pseudo element on the main <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;a></code>).

Producing a continuous flow of words should be easier than this.</p>\n<p>Even now, I’m tempted to spin that previous sentence around in my head over and over, thinking about how I could word it better, or how I could make the point more creatively.</p>\n<p>But you know what? I won’t! Because it states exactly my point, and it’s fine the way it is.</p>\n<p>I feel like I have tons of ideas, bouncing from one thought to another, making intuitive leaps, and it is just a challenge to get it written down. By the time I’m half way through a sentence, I’ve already made several parallel branches in my head of new possibilities I want to go to.</p>\n<p>And by the time I finally get something together, I run it through the ol’ meat grinder over and over again, before scrapping it. What a chore!</p>\n<p>It almost feels like being lost in the woods, constantly backtracking, doubting where I am going.</p>\n<p><strong>There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.</strong> <em>* Ernest Hemmingway *</em></p>\n<p>Thinking, on the other hand, comes naturally. I can get lost in thought for great gulfs of time. But putting those thoughts into concise sentences in writing is always a challenge. For some reason, it’s much easier to do it in real time whilst babbling out words to a person directly with my mouth.</p>\n<p>The only writing I am used to is technical writing, where specificity and clarity is key. Creative writing is much more challenging. And to a logic-worshiping creature such as myself that always sees the world through a lens of rationality, it is fairly easy to visualize what I am trying to accomplish with technical writing. This is not so with creative writing.</p>\n<p>With technical writing, the outline, structure, and details sort of just materialize on their own. I guess this is because is all makes perfectly logic sense up front in the first place, and my job at that point is to communicate it clearly.</p>\n<p>This is very different than communicating creatively.</p>\n<p>With creative writing, I find myself endlessly polishing, rewording, and tweaking what I write, which turns writing into an ordeal for me. I end up with a jumbled mess of ideas scattered around, before thinking up more topics of blog posts I suddenly become passionate about and move onto.</p>\n<p>Seriously, I must have like a dozen unfinished posts now.</p>\n<p>So instead of applying my tried-and-true technical writing approach to creative writing, I’m trying something new. I’m writing in near stream-of-conscious. And I’m not going to go back and doubt every little word in every sentence.</p>\n<p>I’m currently reading the diary of Anne Frank. For a young teenager scribbling away in a diary that she probably thought nobody would ever read, she sure is an excellent writer. And a creative one at that.</p>\n<p>In fact, she writes better than most blog I’ve seen. I’m not sure if it’s because she wasn’t overthinking it, of if she just had a unique combination of maturity, individuality, and intelligence for her age, or if she was a natural-born writer who would’ve blossomed into a successful writing career had she survived into adulthood..</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>.. ok, back. From a sudden Anne Frank <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wiki%20spiral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia spiral</a>. Anyways, I wish I could write as easily as Anne Frank.</p>\n<p>Moving along though, I have a great interest in writing. Not my writing, gods no. But in the writing of others. Introspective perception is what it’s all about for me.</p>\n<p>Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, and one thing I really appreciate is all the little nuances authors go through in their writing; the way they spin words and play with them, the sort of imagery they invoke, and the chain reaction of thought they’re able to trigger with the shortest of sentences.</p>\n<p>Underground and 90’s gangster rappers excel in this regard, exceptionally so.</p>\n<p>So let’s see here. I’ve managed to jump topics from writing perfectionism, to technical writing and thinking, to all my unfinished posts, to Anne Frank, to books, and then to rappers.</p>\n<p>And I’m ok with that. Perhaps it’s better this way.</p>\n<p>And hey, that was actually pretty fun that time.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A Journey into Mental Healthcare Innovation","description":"In August 2022, I embarked on a new adventure","slug":"/blog/kai-and-therify","date":"2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Culture","Startup","Healthcare"],"draft":false},"html":"<p>In February 2021, I embarked on a new adventure by joining <a href=\"https://therify.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Therify</a>, a mental healthcare startup with a powerful vision: to make culturally responsive mental health care accessible to individuals and organizations alike. As someone who thrives on building meaningful products and has a deep interest in startups, this opportunity felt like the perfect alignment of my skills, values, and passions.</p>\n<h1>Why Therify’s Mission Resonated with Me</h1>\n<p>Mental health is a topic close to my heart.\r\nWhen I learned about Therify’s mission—to connect people with therapists who understand their cultural, personal, and professional challenges—I knew this was more than just another tech project. It was a chance to make a real impact.</p>\n<p>As a <strong>product-minded</strong> engineer, I’m not just about writing code.\r\nI’m about solving problems, creating intuitive user experiences, and contributing to business goals.\r\nTherify’s business idea—leveraging technology to empower diverse communities through personalized mental health support—immediately sparked my curiosity.\r\nIt wasn’t just a service; it was a movement to address a critical gap in healthcare.</p>\n<h1>Building with Purpose</h1>\n<p>From the moment I joined, I dove into projects that pushed me to think beyond the technical.\r\nWorking on features like AI-powered therapist matching, secure teletherapy, and analytics for employer insights, I found myself at the intersection of tech innovation and human connection.</p>\n<p>I approached each task with a product-first mindset, always asking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>How does this feature improve the user’s experience?</em></li>\n<li><em>How does it support Therify’s broader mission and business growth?</em></li>\n<li><em>What’s the long-term value we’re creating for individuals and organizations?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Joining a startup like Therify meant stepping into a dynamic, fast-paced environment.\r\nEvery decision felt pivotal, every line of code impactful.\r\nI loved collaborating with a passionate team who shared a common goal: to redefine how mental health care is delivered.</p>\n<p>For me, startups are all about building from the ground up, taking calculated risks, and driving innovation.\r\nTherify was no exception.\r\nIt offered me the chance to combine my technical expertise with my passion for solving meaningful problems, all while contributing to a business idea that truly mattered.</p>\n<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>\n<p>My journey with Therify has reaffirmed my belief in the power of technology to create positive change.\r\nIt’s a reminder that the work we do as engineers isn’t just about software; it’s about people—their needs, their struggles, and their growth.</p>\n<p>Looking back, I’m grateful for the opportunity to join a company that values both innovation and impact.\r\nAnd as we continue to build and grow, I’m excited to see how we can further push the boundaries of what mental health care can achieve.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Docker Compose Error","description":"docker-compose version discrepancies","slug":"/blog/docker-error","date":"2019-12-13","tags":["WordPress","Docker"],"draft":false},"html":"<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>Recently while updating with <a href=\"https://github.com/Upstatement/skela-wp-theme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Skela</a> with webpack, I encountered a weird error where I wasn't able to run a simple script:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-code-title\">bin/composer</div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token shebang important\">#!/bin/bash</span>\r\n<span class=\"token function\">docker-compose</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">exec</span> <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-w</span> /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/skela wordpress <span class=\"token function\">composer</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"<span class=\"token variable\">$@</span>\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>When trying to run this script via <code class=\"language-text\">./bin/composer install</code>, I got this error in my terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">ERROR: Setting workdir <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">exec</span> is not supported <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> API <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">1.35</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1.30</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The error was coming from the <code class=\"language-text\">-w</code> flag in the <code class=\"language-text\">docker-compose exec</code> command in the <code class=\"language-text\">composer</code> script.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Turns The fix was to update the version in my <code class=\"language-text\">docker-compose.yml</code> file to from version <code class=\"language-text\">3.5</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">3.6</code>.

I was trying to modify a non-https domain from a https domain. Switching to a non-https WP admin allowed me to publish posts with no problem.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
